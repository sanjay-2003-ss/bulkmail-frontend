# 📧 BulkMail – Full Stack Email Sending Web App  

BulkMail is a **full-stack email automation web application** built using **HTML, TailwindCSS, JavaScript (frontend)** and **Node.js, Express.js (backend)**.  
It allows users to compose, manage, and send multiple emails simultaneously through a clean and responsive interface.  
This project demonstrates **frontend–backend integration**, **API communication**, and **email sending functionality** in a production-style setup.

## 📘 Overview  

The **BulkMail App** was created to understand how real-world email tools combine frontend interactivity with backend functionality.  
Users can compose messages, add multiple recipients, and send them directly through the integrated backend API.  
While simple in scope, it reflects a realistic flow of how modern web apps handle communication between **client and server**.

## ✨ Features  

- 📨 **Compose and Send Emails** – Users can add a subject, message, and multiple recipients.  
- 👥 **Bulk Sending** – Supports sending emails to multiple addresses in one request.  
- 💬 **Frontend–Backend Integration** – Uses `fetch()` to send data to the backend API.  
- 📩 **Live Response Feedback** – Displays success or error messages in real time.  
- 💡 **Form Validation** – Basic input validation on both client and server sides.  
- 📱 **Responsive UI** – Fully optimized for desktop and mobile devices using TailwindCSS.  
- ⚡ **Deployed on Vercel** – Both frontend and backend are hosted on separate Vercel environments.

## 🔗 Integration Flow  

1. The **frontend** captures email details (recipients, subject, message).  
2. A `fetch()` POST request is sent to the **backend API endpoint**.  
3. The **backend** validates input and triggers **Nodemailer** to send the emails.  
4. The backend returns a JSON response.  
5. The **frontend** displays feedback (success/error) to the user.  

💡 Learning Outcomes
Gained hands-on experience integrating frontend and backend.
Learned to handle HTTP requests and JSON responses using fetch() and Express.
Practiced Nodemailer integration for sending real emails via backend.
Strengthened understanding of CORS, API design, and deployment workflows.
Improved at building responsive UIs with TailwindCSS.
Gained confidence deploying multi-service projects on Vercel.

⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is for educational and practice purposes only.
It is not intended for large-scale or commercial email marketing.
All email operations rely on testing credentials and secure environment variables.

🎯 Outcome

The final version of BulkMail is a fully functional full-stack application combining a responsive frontend with an integrated backend API.
It demonstrates how to build, connect, and deploy separate services while maintaining clean architecture and user-focused design.

🧩 Future Improvements
